        <h2>School Work</h2>
        <p>Below is a small sample of the work created in schools as part of the digital skills program running in North Uist, Benbecula and South Uist 2019 - 2020.
        Pupils learned a range of digital skills starting with the Scratch graphic programming language and in some cases going on to learn the Python programming language.
        Pupils at Sgoil Lionacleit, Sgoil Uibhist a Tuath and Sgoil-an-Iochdair worked on websites using HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h2>Game Jam 2019</h2>
        <p>Pupils from Sgoil an Iochdair took part in a national game jame in summer 2019. They were set the challenge of creating a game around the theme of 'space'
        within a day. Code was uploaded to a central server. Most participants were in Glasgow so we kept in touch with organisers via online.</p>

    <h2>Experimental Music Workshop at Sgoil Dhalabroig</h2>
    <p>Inspired by aleatoric compositions by John Cage (Williams Mix) and David Tudor (Rainforest) we used Scratch to build tiny synthesisers
    with three functions: short sound, looped sound and chaotic sound.</p>
